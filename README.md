# Data-Visualisation-Project-using-Microsoft-Power-BI
This repository contains files/codes for my Data Visualization projects and reports created using Microsoft Power BI

Project Aims: To build a visualisation dashboard using Microsoft Power BI to derive insights from the sales data of a coffee chain.

Below highlights several dashboards that has been built:

- The sales overview dashboard is a visual representation of sales data and it provides an overview of the coffee chainâ€™s key performance indicators

- The sales comparison dashboard is designed to facilitate the sales comparison between branches of coffee chains

- The year-over-year analysis dashboard is designed to determine the changes, analyze growth and recognize trends on an annual basis

- The profit analysis by product dashboard is designed to analyse the profit gained for each of the products

- The sales by product dashboard is designed to investigate how well a product is progressing in sales and how well the marketing investment towards that certain product in a certain area is translated into sales
